# INFIX_TO_POSTFIX
The conversion of an infix expression to a postfix expression involves a systematic approach to handle operators, operands, and parentheses. The infixToPostfix function employs a stack data structure to store operators and parentheses, ensuring that the correct order of operations is maintained. When an operand is encountered, it is directly appended to the postfix expression. When an operator is encountered, its precedence is compared with the top operator on the stack. If the encountered operator has higher precedence, it is pushed onto the stack. Otherwise, the top operator is popped from the stack and appended to the postfix expression until the stack is empty or an operator with lower precedence is found. This process continues until all characters in the infix expression have been processed, resulting in a precise conversion to a postfix expression.
